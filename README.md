# Intro
This GitHub page details a project done by Brett Bernstein and Cameron Modisett as part of the completion of GPGN590 at the Colorado School of Mines. Herein we discuss the creation of a low-cost, drone-based magnetometer using Arduino microcontrollers. May this page be a reference to those who come after.


# Why dronemag?
Drones are becoming increasingly prevalent in the geophysics industry. Equipment can be mounted on a drone to collect data similar to those of a ground survey, but the drone is more efficient than a human operator, and drones can fly surveys in areas where human traversal is impossible. Magnetometers are a prime candidate to mount on a drone because they record the Earth's passive magnetic field without the need to create a source field. From locating buried orebodies to underground utilities and pipelines, magnetics can help pinpoint the location and depth of objects that are important to everyday life. As is common in the geophysics industry, equipment to perform these surveys can cost up to tens-of-thousands of dollars. Two common industry-grade magnetometers include the Geometrics MagArrow (https://baam.tech/design/product/magarrow-uav-enabled-magnetometer/) and the QuSpin total-field magnetometer (https://quspin.com/qtfm/). The MagArrow is a fully-formed magnetic sensor with GPS and IMU onboard, clocking in at $36,000. The QuSpin magnetometer is just the magnetic sensor and still costs $10,000 for a single unit. These prices may be affordable for larger companies and organizations, but are beyond the range of possibility for many smaller organizations that, for example, need to survey a battlefield for unexploded ordnaces (UXOs). We explore a low-cost magnetomer unit using Arduino microcontrollers and compatible sensors, and compare data collected with our design to data collected by the MagArrow.

# Sensor Components 
There are a few primary motivations for choosing Arduino as the brain of our magnetometer. First is the price, an Arduino MEGA 2560 costs only $38.94 but can easily interface with a large number of sensors. Those sensors are typically easily to interface with, code-wise, often requiring little documentation. 

Aside from the Arduino, the magnetometer is the most important component. We use the DRV425EVM magnetometer (https://www.ti.com/tool/DRV425EVM), approximately $24.00. This component outputs a voltage, which can be transformed to true magnetic reading using V_out / (4 * 12.2 * R1), where V_out is the voltage reading and R1 is the resistance of one of the resistors on the sensor. We found R1 to be 200 Ohms, confirmed not by voltmeter but by comparing the output with the known value of the magnetic field in the location. R1 may vary for different versions of this sensor. The output is in mT and can be converted to nT (the standard magnetic field unit) by multiplying by 10^6.

We want our magnetometer to record not just temporally-, but spatially-varying data, so it is important that we have an accurate clock and GPS. Both of these are achieved using the NEO-6M GPS module (https://www.digikey.com/htmldatasheets/production/2757457/0/0/1/neo-6.html), $2.75. From this we acquire the latitude, longitude, and time at which each data point is recorded. 

In order to store the recorded data we need some sort of microSD card interface. We use the HiLetgo W5100 ethernet shield (https://www.amazon.com/Ethernet-Shield-Network-Expansion-Arduino/dp/B00AXVX5D0), $20.99, which has a built-in microSD slot. The provided code stores magnetic and GPS location/date/time values to a microSD card, which can be transferred to a computer for further use using an SD reader.

A power supply is necessary to run the Arduino. We use an 11.1v battery. The battery alone was too strong and caused issues with the Arduino. Tyical resistors would burn up when set between the battery and the Arduino, so we use a 10 Ohm resistor rated for 100 W to ensure proper power is delivered to the Arduino.

# Sensor Wiring

Figure () depicts the wiring diagram. The ethernet shield is plugged into the top of the Arduino, and we use the following connections.

# Mounting device on drone

A 3D-printed housing, figure (), was created to hold the Arduino and the sensors. The housing was mounted on a drone created by students at the Colorado School of Mines. We used this drone/housing combo to fly a survey and test the sensor
